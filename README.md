# Coding-Gaming-Quiz

## About The Project

The goal of this project was to create an interactive JavaScript quiz that allows the user to save their score and continue to take the quiz and save hteir score to compare their progress over time. 

### Built With

* HTML 
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Getting Started

In order to acess this website, just visit the following webpage: [https://github.com/andrewbreytenbach/coding-game-quiz](https://github.com/andrewbreytenbach/coding-game-quiz)

To get a local copy up and running, simply view the index.html file, stle.css, or the script.js file and see how you can play around, copy, and edit the file for personal usage. You can also change the questions and answers by navigating into the JavaScript file and changing the array options. 

## Usage

Once the user first acceses the website, the following image is what they will find: 

![Start Page](/screenshots/start-page.png "Start Page")

This is the start page for the quiz. In order to begin the quiz and start the timer, the user will need to click the 'Start' button. Once the user clicks the button, the quiz begins, as shown below:

![First Question](/screenshots/first-question.png "First Question")

Depending on the answer the user selects, they will either be told 'Correct!' or 'Incorrect!' immediately, as shown below:

![Correct](/screenshots/correct.png "Correct")

After the user works their way through all of the questions OR the time runs out, whichever happens first, they will see this page:

![Submit Score](/screenshots/submit-score.png "Submit Score")

Here, they will be prompted to enter their initials to log their score. Their score will then be stored at the High Scores page, which looks like this: 

![High Scores](/screenshots/high-scores-page.png "High Scores")

Here, the browser will store their score each time they retake the quiz and then save it to their initials, so they can compare their progress each time they take the quiz.
