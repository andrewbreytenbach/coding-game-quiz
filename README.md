### Built With

* HTML 
* CSS

## Getting Started

In order to acess this website, just visit the following webpage: [https://github.com/andrewbreytenbach/coding-game-quiz](https://github.com/andrewbreytenbach/coding-game-quiz)

To get a local copy up and running, simply view the index.html file, stle.css, or the script.js file and see how you can play around, copy, and edit the file for personal usage. You can also change the password criteria to your personal needs by adjusting the if functions and the variables associated with each prompt. 

## Usage

Once the user fist acceses the website, the following image is what they will find: 

![Website without the password generated](/empty.png "Empty Image")

After clicking the 'Generate Password' red button, the user will be given a series of prompts asking them to enter in the number of characters they want the password to have, and then a series of prompts asking if it needs to be uppercase, lowercase, numeric, or containing symbols. Once all of these prompt boxes are selected, then the user is given a generated password in the text box as shown below:

![Website the password generated](/generated-password.png "Generated Password")

Based on the answers given to each prompt, the specific criteria of each password will differ slightly.
